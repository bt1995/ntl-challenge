# Frontend Challenge

## Technologies used

I've used some libraries and native JS features for this challenge:

- ReactJS, as my framework.
- Redux for storing small datas.
- Generous use of localStorage for data storage.

## Steps to build, deploy and test the app

- `npm install` to install necessary dependencies for the app
- `npm start` to start the app
- `npm build` to compile the app for production mode
- `npm test` launching the tests
- `npm lint` checking the code
